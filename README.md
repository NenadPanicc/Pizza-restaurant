During the development of this project i have learned the following things:
 - How to make an animation algorithm that is manipulating two elements's z-index therefore creating the illusion that 3 elements are        moving, while changing their src image at specific times and adding or removing text on top of it depending on the point where the        animation is currently at.
 - How to create an image slider whose elements get back on the other side once they reach the end of the screen width.
 - How to create a fully functional modal.
 - How to create an Animate on Scroll function that is calculating the spacing between the current position and the top of the page          onScroll and therefore executing a certain animation at specific points.
 - How to attach or detach a CSS animation class to an element in JavaScript.
